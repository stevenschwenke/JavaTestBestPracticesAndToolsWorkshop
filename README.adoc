= Java Test Best Practices and Tools Workshop

This is a demonstration of multiple best practices, frameworks, libs and tools for testing Java applications. Although some features are only available in Spring applications, some should generally be applicable for Java code.

This workshop is not intended for test-driven development (TDD), but for testing existing code.

To have a codebase to write tests for, this repository contains a partial copy of the backend code of https://www.ithubbs.de[the IT Hub Brunswick].

== Suggested workshop walkthrough

. Disclaimer: This is not about TDD, but for writing tests for an existing codebase!
. (optional) Demonstrate use-case by showing IT Hub with admin UI.
. Show overall architecture via short code review.
.. Main take-away: Controller -> Services -> Repositories.
.. Background: Single Responsibility Principle.
.. Slicing by business functionality, not technical aspects.
. *Method*: Develop a test-architecture: how to test different parts of the codebase?
.. Controllers: test separately as unit tests because of clear and isolated task: "do HTTP"
.. Services: Most important task: business functionality. In this application highly coupled with repository-layer. Solution: Test services and repositories together as integration tests.
. Decision: Start testing Controllers, example class for this workshop is AdminEventController
. *Method*: Outline test-cases: Before writing code, just think about what you want to test and write it as a comment. -> Question for listeners: How many tests do you see for this controller?
. Naive approach: just call methods in Controllers -> AdminEventControllerTest_01_methodCalls.java, learning a new method:
. *Method*: Use descriptive method names.
.. long, but give information needed
.. think about when to read this: when test fails and nobody knows the implementation anymore
.. alternative: JUnit 5 display names
. Just write the one test for getting all events to save time. During this example, learn new tool:
. *Tool*: Mockito
. Look at written test: Does this really test what the application is doing? No!
.. Application delivers json, test is not testing this.
.. Application has security features: accessing the method without token not allowed!
.. Hence: Re-write test using Spring MVC Test -> AdminEventControllerTest_02_springmvctest.java, learn new tools:
. *Tool*: Spring MVC Test
. *Tool*: https://stevenschwenke.de/springTestSlices[Spring Testslices]
. Re-write test gettingAllEventsViaAdminEndpointWillReturnEventsAndHTTP200 as shown in AdminEventControllerTest_02_springmvctest.java
. *Tool*: Shortcuts for writing tests (IntelliJ IDEA):
.. Ctrl + Shift + T to switch between implementing class and test class
.. Alt + Insert to generate test methods
.. Ctrl + Shift + F10 to run what is under carret: in method -> run method, between two methods -> run whole test class
.. Ctrl + F5 to rerun
. Switch to next layer: services! Write service-test while mocking repos, see AdminEventServiceImplTest_01_mockRepo.java
.. Validation-annotations in bean are not tested!
. Write service/repo-tests, example AdminEventServiceImplTest.java
. *Method*: Accelerate tests using in-memory databases using Spring Profiles
.. see DatabaseConfigJUnit.java
. *Tool*: Check test coverage with IntelliJ IDEA
. *Tool*: (partial test) ArchUnit in ArchitectureRulesTest.java
